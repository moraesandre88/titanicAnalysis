Hello user! Thanks for being here.

This is a program to show how the presence of outilers in dataframes can influence the results during the analysis.
For this, a well known dataset is used: the Titanic Survival. For those who are not familiar with, this dataset contains 
the data from the Titanic tragedy, witch contains a list of the survivals with their ages, gender, passenger fare, etc.

After cleaning and treating the data, three cases are showed:
1° Case: remove outliers;
2° Case: ignore outliers;
3° Case: replace outliers for the median value.

Seven graphics are generated after that and they all show te same information extracted from each of the cases. All the
analysis was made using pandas and the graphics are generated using seaborn. For more information, i'm leaving the links 
with the documentation of each one in the end of this file.

Last but not least, remember to save all the files in the same paste. Otherwise you will have to specify the path 
to the files in the index.ipynb program. I hope you can appreciate this and all the feedbacks are welcome.
